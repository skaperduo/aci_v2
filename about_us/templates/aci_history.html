<center><h1>ACI History</h1></center>
<br>

<p>
    Late in	1950, retiring public school officials put them together and opted to get things going for a non-sectarian College. Documents, having been hurried in place, the Agusan Colleges (AC) were founded in 1951 in time for SY 1951-52.
</p>
<P>
    AC with its 2-storey semi-concrete structure constructed on a leased lot at San Jose corner M. Calo Sts., opened up for SY 1951-52. It started with basic and high school education, typing and stenography, dressmaking and tailoring, beauty culture, 1-year Secretarial course, Elementary Teachers Certificate, Associate in Commercial Science, and Associate in Arts. These were the same programs offered until SY 1955-56.
</P>
<p>
    The enrollment in all levels increased year after year. It had no fewer than 400 students for SY 1955-56. This trend inspired the Administration to come up with 4-year courses. These were: Bachelor of Science in Commerce (BSC); Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE); Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education (BSEED); and Bachelor of Arts (AB). These courses sparked a new high in enrollment of no less than 600 for SY 1956-57.
</p>
<p>
    Nonetheless, during SY 1957-58, the Administration could not sink its roots deeper due to interventions from influential stockholders. Faced with strong resistance from the former, the latter opted to close AC and released the same for sale.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Federico C. Chanjueco, who was then the dean of Commerce of Urios College (UC), also in Butuan City, acquired AC. He reopened it for SY 1959-60 with a new name: Agusan College of Commerce and Technology (ACCT) to shake off its misfortune. But by reason of documentation problem, he decided to retain its original AC identity for SY 1960-61.
</p>
<p>
    In SY 1959-60, AC was reopened. It had only 236 enrollees. In an effort to hike its population, Mr. Chanjueco, the president and director, facilitated the opening of new courses. These were: Associate in Mechanical Engineering (AME); Associate in Secretarial Sciences (ASS); and Electronic Technology (ET), Radio Repair and Practical Electricity were included as vocational subjects in the high school. True to expectation, the enrollment soared up to a little less than 700 in SY 1961-62.
</p>
<p>
    Inspired by the uptrend in student population, the Administration, starting SY 1962-63, added more programs, such as: Master of Arts in Education (MAED) and Master of Science in Business Administration (MSBA). Three (3) years thereafter (SY 1965-66), courses were offered: Bachelor of Laws (LLB); Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BS Crim); and Bachelor of Science in Accountancy (BSA). With the end in view of complementing these programs, the Administration employed new faculty, who were second to none in their fields of discipline, from Butuan City and elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
   The shining glory of AC with respect to student population was during SY 1968-69. The enrollment for the 1st semester scaled over the 5,000 mark. The Administration, to accommodate them, leased six (6) commercial buildings within the hub of the city. However, by a stroke of bad luck during the 2nd semester of that School year, a big fire razed down the city’s business center, reducing to ground zero the school’s original structure and sparing none of its leased buildings.
</p>
<p>
    In an attempt to salvage the situation, the Administration took no time to rent eight (8) commercial buildings at separate locations. Subsequently, AC acquired some of them, such as: Spandonis Bldg. (now the HS Bldg.); Macasero Bldg. (now Administration Building); and Patanao Bldg. Later, it added: the Ordona compound (College Building), the Marcos Calo lot (1,000 sqm.); six (6) has Lot at KM.3, Brgy. Libertad (Elem. Dept.); Busa Bldg.(FCC Residence); and the 16-has. Land at Brgy. Bancasi (Venue of off-campus activities).
</p>
<p>
    In spite of the efforts of the Administration with Sir. Chanjueco at the helm, a Summa Cum Laude BSC graduate from FEU, the enrollment for SY 1969-70 decreased by 40% from that of SY 1968-69. When Martial Law was declared in 1972, the enrollment further dwindled to no more than 2,000.
</p>
<p>
    Prior to the opening of SY 1972-73, the Administration closed its LLB and BSCrim. Much earlier, it shut down its voc- tech courses, including this of a 2-year Mechanical Engineering course. Correspondingly, it reduced its faculty to what was essential.
</p>
<p>
    Since then, the enrollment continued to decline. It was theorized by Sir. Chanjueco, a CPA Board topnotcher, that one of the reasons for it was the school’s inferior physical plant aside from being scattered at different locations.
</p>
<p>
    Agusan Colleges, to even the field, constructed a 3-storey concrete structure during SY 1999-2000 at its Ariola Compound was inaugurated in time for its Golden Anniversary on February 14, 2001. 	On February 14, 2001, AC celebrated its Golden Year Anniversary.
</p>
<p>
    On August 27, 2001, AC Founder and President Federico Cueto Chanjueco Jr. passed away.
</p>
<p>
  Shortly after the elder Chanjueco was laid to rest, the School’s set-up was reengineered. Dr. Hercules R. Chanjueco, Ed.D, CPA, +EE were installed by the stockholders-children as president. Later, he was elected chairman of the new board of directors. (BoD).
</p>
<p>
    The newly constituted BoD mandated the reorganization of the management hierarchy. The top management, which used to be composed of President-director and assistant director, was changed to president, executive vice president (EVP) and three(3) vice president (VP) for administrative, academic and student affairs.
</p>
<p>
   The new president, Dr. Hercules R. Chanjueco, appointed Ms. Thucydides Chanjueco-Sadiasa EVP; Capt. Hannibal R. Chanjueco, VP for Administrative affairs; Mr. Hamilcar R. Chanjueco, VP for Academic Affairs; and Mr. Ediseo H. Tidalgo, Vp for Student Affairs. These appointments were subsequently confirmed by the BoD.
</p>
<p>
   With the green light from the BoD, the president introduced improvements to the Administration Bldg. in 2002. Late in 2003, he managed to acquire a lot consisting of 1,000 sqm. intended for the elementary and high school structures.  This site is just the immediate south of the Administration Bldg. and stone throw from the new College Bldg.
</p>
<p>
    During SY 2003-2004, the total student population was 1,859 in all levels. This figure was broken down into: Graduate, 100; Tertiary, 1,472; HS 205; and Elem, 82. This number does not include those from special courses. On the other hand, the faculty count (part-time and full-time), was 74. When apportioned by level: Graduate, 9; Tertiary, 50; Secondary and Elementary at 8 each.
</p>
<p>
    As of SY 2004-2005, AC offers the following programs: MAEd, MSBA, BSC, BEEd, BSEd, and Bachelor of Science in Math (BSM), 2-Year computer Secretarial Course (CSC), Complete Elementary and Secondary Education. It also offers TESDA-regulated courses, such as: 1 yr. Data Encoder; 2-yr. Office Administration; and 2-yr. Computer Technician. More so, it offered special course:  Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Publisher, and Database Management.
